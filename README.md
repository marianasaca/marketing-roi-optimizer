# 🚀 Marketing Campaign Optimization Engine

### **Executive Summary**
As a Brand Strategist turned Data Scientist, I know that knowing *what* happened isn't enough—we need to know *why* and *what to do next*.

This project answers a critical business question: **"How can we reallocate our marketing budget to maximize ROI?"**

Using a dataset of **300,000 ad campaigns**, I built an end-to-end analytics pipeline that combines SQL data engineering, Machine Learning (Linear Regression), and an interactive Streamlit dashboard to simulate budget scenarios.

### **Key Strategic Insights**
* **🚫 The Budget Drain:** "Pinterest" campaigns were identified as a major inefficiency, consistently underperforming other channels by a factor of **3x** (Coefficient: -3.26).
* **✅ The Opportunity:** Reallocating the Pinterest budget to **Instagram Product Launches** is projected to increase overall ROI significantly.
* **📍 Regional Optimization:** Miami audiences responded 15% better to "Sales" focused goals compared to "Awareness" goals, suggesting a need for more direct Call-to-Actions (CTAs) in that region.

**Features:**
* **Real-time Filtering:** Slice 300k rows by Channel, Goal, and Region instantly.
* **ROI Simulator:** Visualizing the impact of cutting low-performing channels.
* **Strategy Ranking:** An SQL-powered leaderboard of the top-performing campaign combinations.
